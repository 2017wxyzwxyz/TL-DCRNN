TL-DCRNN: Transfer Learning with Graph Neural Networks for Short-Term Highway Traffic Forecasting

## Data Preparation
Download the traffic data files for entire California ['speed.h5'](https://anl.box.com/s/7hfhtie02iufy75ac1d8g8530majwci0), adjacency matrix  ['adj_mat.pkl'](https://anl.box.com/s/4143x1repqa1u26aiz7o2rvw3vpcu0wp) and distance between sensors ['distances.csv'](https://anl.box.com/s/cfnc6wryh4yrp58qfc5z7tyxbbpj4gek),  
and keep in the `data/input_files/` folder.
